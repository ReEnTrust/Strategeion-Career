# Strategeion Career

OVERVIEW
--------
- Strategeion Career is a shortlisting system providing 3 types of explanations about its decisions to job applicants.
- Strategeion Career was designed to evaluate how job applicants felt empowered by each explanation.
- Strategeion Career was designed as part of an online experiment to evaluate each explanation. Therefore, the platform is divided into 3 Experiments, each experiment corresponding to an explanation type. 
- Participants to the online experiment had to pretend they were job applicants, apply to the offer presented to them and then join each Experiment one after the other.
- For each Experiment, participants are shortlisted by one of 3 different models and see one of the 3 explanation types.
